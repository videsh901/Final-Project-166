  <p> Black Mirror is a show I recommend everyone to watch. 
  It’s about technologies in the distant future and its effect on society.
  Each show has a different plot and colorful cast of characters. 
  So you can watch the show out-of-order. 
  Some refers to the show as being a modern-day twilight zone type show except its focus is on technology, instead of the paranormal. 
  Each episode leaves you with questions to ponder about the future of technology.
  Every episode ends with a moral lesson about using technology.
  Most of the plot points are drawing from today’s society. 
  For example the episode nosedive focus on a society built around how popular a person is.
  Each individual is given a number rating by people based on their interaction with that person.
  The higher you’re rated the better you are treated. 
  It draws similarities to applications we use like Instagram and other social media apps.
  Most people like this show because it gives a realistic world with futuristic technology end it.
  Also most episode don’t end happy, instead it gives a look into a possible reality. 
  This is a breath of fresh air from Hollywood sugar-coated outlook of society. To get a preview of the TV show check out this trailer

     <h2> <font color='#6280f6'> Inside No.9 (TV Series 2014-) Review: A show that will leave you with tears of laughter </font> </h2>

     <br>
     <br>

     <p> Inside no. 9 is a dark comedy television show based in London. 
     Each episode is a tale filled with dark themes told to the viewer in a comedic way.
     Each episode is a stand alone, meaning there is no continuation to follow. 
     Every episode is filmed on a new sett with a fresh new cast, excluding the two creators of the series.
     Some episodes will leave you laughing, while others will leave you with something to ponder over. 
     If you are a fan of dark humor, I highly recommend this show to you. 
     There are episodes that tend to drag on and can be stale. 
     So I suggest you go on a message board like Reddit and ask what are some good episodes to check out. 
     One of my favorite episode from this show is season 1 episode 4 titled “Last Gasp”. 
     It’s about a pop star paying a visit to a sick fan of his.
     As the episode goes on the pop star dies from blowing up a balloon for the fan. 
     Then the parents and his management team begin arguing over the balloon since it was his last breath that could be sold for a fortune.
     Another episode I highly recommend to check out is season 1 episode 2 titled “A Quiet Night In”.
     This is the funniest episode in the entire series and the weird part is it doesn’t have any dialogue.
     It’s a show where I recommend only a few episodes to be watched.To get a preview of the TV show check out this trailer

  <br>
  
  <p> 
    Berserk is an anime set in medieval times.
    I don’t want to spoil the anime, so I will just give an brief overview. 
    Berserk is an anime with the main protagonist being Guts. 
    It centers around Guts struggles to find a place to call home in the beginning, then finally finding one, then going on a killing spree for revenge. 
    There is a lot of gore in this anime and the manga. 
    If you’re someone that can look past that then you’re in for a treat.
    The best thing this anime has going for it is it’s attention to characterization. 
    All the characters in this anime are well developed.
    The story of this anime tells makes you have sympathy for the characters. 
    The main character of this anime is less heroic and more amoral than other heroes.
    This makes Guts more human than other heroes. 
    The questionable decisions he makes come from his philosophy that strength is the only thing you need.
    He is also not someone overly powerful like superman. He always have to find up new ways to overcome a new enemy. 
    The meat of the story happens in the manga which continues where the anime leave off. To get a preview of the anime check out this trailer

  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p>
  Tales from the crypt is a television show that ran from 1989-1996. 
  The show is based around horror themes, suspense, and dark comedy. The host of the show is known as the crypt keeper. 
  He is a skeleton puppet of the show that provides a brief plot introduction as to what is going to happen in the episode to follow. 
  The show does not follow continuation. Each episode is a stand alone.
  The tales told by the crypt keeper often revolve around greed, lust, revenge, murder, and jealousy.
  Most of the episodes conclude with a twist at the end of the show. 
  The downside to this is after a while you can figure out what the ending is going to be. 
  So the mass suspense built up throughout the episode is ruined.
  There are some episodes that can be pretty boring and have minimum to no plot to it.
  Others might have a stronger cast of colorful characters. 
  One of my favorite episode from this show is season 5 episode 1 titled “Death Of Some Salesman”. 
  It features a charismatic salesman that con unsuspecting people out of burial rights.
  His luck turns for worse overtime when he knocks on the wrong door. 
  I don’t want to spoil the rest of the episode for you, but you should definitely watch it.

  <p>
    Time Lapse is one of the best science fiction movies I saw this year. 
    The plot of this move center around a machine that can take photos one day into the future at an object it is direct at.
    The three friends of this movie decide to exploit this machine technique for personal gains.
    They decide to use the machine to place bet on racing game.
    As the movie progresses, one of the friends gets greedier than the rest. 
    This new development in the story also brings with it jealously, greed, betrayal, and violence. 
    It was interesting to watch the complex relationship between these three characters. 
    Each of them had a goal as to why they want to use the machine. 
    One for greed, one for success, and one to rekindle love. 
    I really enjoy the concept of a time travel photo machine in this movie. 
    The writers brought a fresh breath of air to the time traveling genre with this movie. 
    Throughout this movie I was at the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen next. 
    I highly recommend anyone that like science fiction thriller movies to take the plunge and watch this film.

    <br>
    <br>
    
    <p>
      Lost is a science fiction thriller show about a group of strangers stranded on a supernatural island after a plane crash.
      Lost is a unique show from the rest of the shows in this genre.
      Instead of the plot of the series driving the story forward, it is in fact the characters that makes this series so iconic. 
      Each character of the show is perfectly flawed. They each bring with them secrets and hidden pasts to the island.
      As the story progress there is a complex bond that form between the characters. 
      Every character has a driving forcing for them to get off the island. 
      I think the mysterious island and the unknown monsters that live on it is just a added bonus to this great show. 
      The main theme of this show is of self-reflection. The more the cast is on the show they start to questioning their lives and how they live it.
      The main character of the show Jack Shepherd is a doctor that has an obsession with saving people. He is the leader among the group of strangers.
      The people of the island view him as someone who is hero. They are dependent on him alone to guide them to safety and a way off the island.
      I highly recommend for anyone interested in science fiction thriller genre to give this show a shot.
