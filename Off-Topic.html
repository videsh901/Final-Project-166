  <p> The Fermi's Paradox asks the question that if they are billions of planets in 
    the universe then how come we have not discover alien life yet. 
    The number of planets that could have the conditions for life on it is in the 100,000s. 
    There are a few explanations draw from this paradox. 
    Maybe there are alien life on other planets but we can not communicate with them. 
    Or Maybe there exist advanced alien civilzations that want to remain hidden from us to observe humans. 
    The last one is that maybe we truly are alone in the universe.
